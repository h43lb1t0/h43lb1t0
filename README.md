ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tom (@h43lb1t0)

Mainly I am interested in Python development, but through the university partly also in Java.

Also, I am a big friend of open source and (almost) all of my public repos are open source. 

Feel free to check out my [repositorys](https://github.com/h43lb1t0?tab=repositories)
